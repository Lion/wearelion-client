        <h2>Our development stack</h2>
        <p>We strongly believe in opinionated development frameworks - these force a consistent manner of programming that easily allows us to add additional team members or hand over a project to another team (such as in-house team).</p>

              <h3>Front end</h3>
              <p>Our favourite front-end development framework is <strong>ember.js</strong>.</p>
              <p>Ember code is is developed rapidly, reducing costs, it is clean and opinionated so can readily be picked up by other developers, and encourages a stable, enterprise-quality code.</p>

              <h3>Back end</h3>
              <p>We prefer to use <strong>Rails 5</strong> as this has new API features that work well with ember.js. It makes for an efficient server with enterprices-ready stability.</p>
              <p>We have experimented extensively with <strong>Phoenix</strong> - the level of control that this framework, and the langugage its written on, Erlan, makes for blistering fast applications.</p>

              <h3>Database</h3>
              <p>My SQL is our preferred database engine. We love the features in PostGres, but the deep community and speed of My SQL provides for faster, apps in a shorter time.</p>

            <p>We enjoy helping in-house development teams adopting new technologies and successfully implementing these technologies.</p>
            <p>We also have extensive experience with PHP, node.js, customised WordPress and Expression Engine. We have had excellent results using Laravel to quickly and easily modernise existing applications.</p>
